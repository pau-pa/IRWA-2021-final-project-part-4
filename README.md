## Usage
First of all you will need to create your virtual environment and activate it. Yo can do the following commands:
```
python -m virtualvenv venv
cd venv\Scripts
activate
```

Then you can return to the web-app-main directory and run the code:
```
python web_app.py
```
You will see in the terminal a message displaying your localhost IP and port. Access that address via web browser. It will take some time to load. Once you can acces it, you can write queries you want and you will see the results.


## Requirements
If you don't have some of the packages installed, you will need to download them. Some of them are:
```
pip install deep-translator
pip install jsonpickle
pip install gensim
pip install nltk
```
